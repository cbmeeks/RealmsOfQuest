Source code for Realms of Quest IV by Ghislain de Blois
=======================================================
I programmed Realms of Quest IV for the Commodore VIC-20 in 2013.  This was eventually released commercially by
the retrogaming publisher Psytronik ( see http://www.binaryzone.org/retrostore ).

The development of this game was discussed at the following forum:

A video of this game program can be viewed at:

Notes regarding Realms of Quest III Source Code
===============================================
I include as much as I have remaining of my Realms of Quest III source code that
I had programmed in 2009.  The folder structure within /Realms3Legacy is similar
to that above.
